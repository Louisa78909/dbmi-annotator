Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the open source project dbmi-annotator.js Version 2.0, dbmi-annotator aims to implement templated annotations. This will enable the creation of multiple annotation plugins that meet various use cases, including drug highlight annotation, DDI (drug-drug interaction) annotation, clinical trial annotation and PK(pharmacokinetics annotation).

Drug highlight annotation helps user to identify drug mention on paragraph. Itâ€™s can be clinical drug, active ingredient, drug product, metabolite or drug group. 
DDI annotation is purpose for represents a drug drug interaction information in a structured way. Predesigned DDI form have fields, qualitative or quantitative, that describe the interaction. 
Drug highlight annotation in the text quote of DDI annotation will be added to the field drug mentions, a list box including all drug mention options.
